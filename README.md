# Introduction to Custom Dictionary Application
This is an application that I designed with **Python** for the activity of learning English vocabulary.   
It mainly has **2 functionalities**:  
- Insertion
  - Word or Phrase
  - Example Text
- Viewing  

You can insert any word or phrase that you want and view it later. This is useful when you have learned  
a new word or phrase because the application reminds you the word that you recently learned when you  
are inserting it.  

Also, you can insert an example sentence or paragraph for any word you inserted. Personally, I learned  
many words and phrases from various books, movies, articles, and daily conversations. Hence, saving  
the context was kind of necessary for better learning activity.
