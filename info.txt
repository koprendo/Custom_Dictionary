1) ADD SECTION

*After adding the word and its meaning with its class, the program continues to ask
for another word from you. Therefore, you can add many words without stopping the
program.

*If you want to return main menu, you must click enter.

(WARNING! You can not add a lot of meanings for a word at the same time. You have to
add in turn. For example:

Insert a Word

from any specific word.
For 1. Part:
The program asks a word. After inserting the word, verification process begins.
It asks you to enter the word which will be indicated by the program. Then,
deleting process starts.
For 2. Part:
The program asks for a word. After inserting the word, program lists its meanings.

verification process begins. It asks you to enter the word which will be indicated
